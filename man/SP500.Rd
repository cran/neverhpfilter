\section{Notes from Schiller}{


This data set consists of monthly stock price, dividends, and earnings data and 
the consumer price index (to allow conversion to real values), all starting 
January 1871. The price, dividend, and earnings series are from the same sources 
as described in Chapter 26 of my earlier book (Market Volatility, Cambridge, 
MA: MIT Press, 1989), although now I use monthly data, rather than annual data. 
Monthly dividend and earnings data are computed from the S&P four-quarter totals 
for the quarter since 1926, with linear interpolation to monthly figures. Dividend 
and earnings data before 1926 are from Cowles and associates (Common Stock Indexes,
2nd ed., Bloomington, Ind.: Principia Press, 1939), interpolated from annual 
data. Stock price data are monthly averages of daily closing prices through 
August of 2019. The CPI-U (Consumer Price Index-All Urban Consumers) published by 
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics begins in 1913; for years before 1913, 
I spliced to the CPI Warren and Pearson's price index, by multiplying it by 
the ratio of the indexes in January 1913. December 1999 and January 2000 values 
for the CPI-Uare extrapolated. See George F. Warren and Frank A. Pearson, Gold 
and Prices (New York: John Wiley  and Sons, 1935). Data are from their Table 1, 
pp. 11â€“14.
